## WTF is Scrum?

> "Scrum is the world’s nerdiest team sport." – Some Agile Coach, probably

Scrum is a lightweight **framework for complex work**. It’s iterative, adaptive, and non-hierarchical. Think rugby meets Kanban meets *herding cats*.

### Key Ingredients:

- **Sprints**: 1–4 week cycles, delivering shippable value
- **Roles**: Product Owner, Developers, ScrumMaster
- **Events**: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Retrospective
- **Artifacts**: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment

🧠 Built on empiricism. Inspects reality. Adapts fast. Like evolution—but with post-its and Jira.

## So... What Does a ScrumMaster Actually Do?

> TL;DR: You’re not the boss. You’re the **unseen force** that keeps the team from imploding.

### Responsibilities:

- 🪄 **Facilitator**: Rituals like Daily Standup, Sprint Planning
- 🛡️ **Shield**: Blocks BS from managers, stakeholders, rogue POs
- 🧑‍🏫 **Coach**: Teaches Scrum, encourages Agile mindset
- 🧹 **Janitor**: Removes team impediments—technical or emotional

🎯 You don’t assign tasks. You help others figure it out. You're basically **Yoda with a Trello board**.

| Task Assignment | Yes | No |
| Focus | Scope, Time, Budget | Flow, Health, Value |

- 💸 Budget – Broke or ballin'?

- **Want career growth beyond SM**? → A-CSM, CSP-SM, PSM II/III

## WTF is a SAFe ScrumMaster?

> "Scrum... but make it **corporate**."

**SAFe** = Scaled Agile Framework. Think: org-wide Agile, with 18 ceremonies, 47 acronyms, and your soul crushed under Jira reports.
